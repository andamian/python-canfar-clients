To set up the virtual environment (venv), use build.xml:

$ ant test

To activate environment variables so that it will be available, look
at the output from ant to establish where the temporary virtual
environment is stored, and then source the venv activation script. For
example (bash shell):

$ . /tmp/cadcVOSPy1445465286/bin/activate

All dependencies that are not available globally (defined in
requirements.txt) should now be available.
